Use reg_model_project.Rmd to read the codes for this project. The project was done through Rstudio. 
The data were obtained from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. The data represents 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016. There are 32 variables about the movies.

The raw data is not a complete list of all movies released prior to 2016. It is a random sample taken from the full data set. We don’t know the sampling method. With random sampling, the results are generalizable to all movies in the range of years released between 1970 and 2014.In observational studies, only associations are shown. Association does not imply causation.

A possible non-independent bias may arise with regard to movie sequels whereby the popularity of a sequel movie may be influenced by that of the previous release.

What we seek to explore with this dataset:
Can we predict a movie’s popularity based on type of movie, genre, runtime, imdb rating, imdb number of votes, critics rating, critics score, audience rating, Oscar awards obtained (actor, actress, director and picture)? We hope to find a model with good predicting power to predict the IMDB rate of a movie.
